1. Wildcard route is not working, add '**' to path rather than single asterisk

2. Remove initialization logic from all constructors, into ngOnInit

3. SharedModule is not doing anything and isn't neccessary - However, I did add a pipe to it for the create show component

4. Add form and form listener on create show, to disable button until all Show properties are valid. Also add back button to component

5. On shows-list component/page, disable previous page button if current page is 0, and fix previousPage() function to spread this.pageable and check for index 0

6. Break each individual show row in the list into its own dumb component with Show input and delete show emitter

7. Make show search filtering case insensitive

8. Set up shows facade, and remove all idea of store/state from all components

9. Restructure state folder structure for readability

10. Unit test facade and then shows list for demo purposes
